## Product Title: AI Analyst for Startup Investors

---

### 1. Problem Overview
Early-stage investors are overwhelmed by unstructured data—pitch decks, emails, founder calls, and news. This manual review is inconsistent, slow, and risks missing “red flags”.
**Goal:** Build an AI-powered platform that analyzes multiple data sources and generates actionable, consistent, investor-ready startup insights at scale.

### 2. Target User
- Early-stage Venture Capital investors/analysts
- Angel investors
- Accelerators seeking to streamline deal flow analysis

### 3. Solution Overview
A web-based application, “AI Analyst”, that:
- Accepts startup materials (pitch decks—PDF/text, founder bios, emails, news clips)
- Uses AI/NLP for information extraction and risk scoring
- Delivers investor-focused insights and summaries automatically

---
